                Did you know that ortoisest have an exoskeleton AND an endoskeleton. And unlike turtles, tortoises can't
                swim, but they can hold their breath for a long time!

                    Some turtles lay eggs in the sand and leave them to hatch on their own. The young turtles make their
                    way to the top of the sand and scramble

                <p>
                    In some species of turtle the temperature determines if the egg will develop into a male or female,
                    lower temperatures lead to a male while higher temperatures lead to a female.

                    The Giant Tortoise did not receive a scientific name for over 300 years due to the failure of
                    delivery of specimens to Europe for classification due to their great taste, all were eaten on the
                    voyage back by sailors, even by Charles Darwin.

                    The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (often shortened to TMNT or Ninja Turtles) are four fictional
                    teenaged anthropomorphic turtles named after Italian Renaissance artists. They were trained by their
                    anthropomorphic rat sensei in the art of ninjutsu. From their home in the sewers of New York City,
                    they battle petty criminals, evil overlords, mutated creatures, and alien invaders while attempting
                    to remain hidden from society. They were created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird.
