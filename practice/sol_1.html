        <p>
            By now you know already what my top 3 favourite plant is, but I also really want to show them and give you more information on them!
            See below my cool plants! 
            They all need a lot of sun light and care, so I have put them all in places around the house where they are the happiest and can grow and grow.
            Once a month they also get a special treat; I add some plant vitamins when watering them
